### Known Issues:
- Drag Row feature is not working in Firefox.
- Could not fix table column evo_c-divtable-header simply through CSS. Need some research for JS solutions.
<br></br>
- <s>Sorting will break the evo_c-divtable-row swap feature due to some hard code issues. The root cause has been defined and will be fixed tomorrow.</s>
- <s>Responsive Table Feature is not working on iPhone Chrome.</s>
- <s>Using jQuery .draggable to listen drag & drop events. Need re-write to pure javascript.</s>
- <s>Duplicate code in sorting & style changing logics. Need code refactoring once major features are completed.</s>
- <s>Not all HTML are generated from JS, which is causing a rendering issue when the table is loaded in the first time. Need move all HTML code to JS side.</s>
- <s>The first drag event breaks the page layout.</s>
- <s>The first drag event is not invoking transition properties</s>.
- <s>Lost hover affect after clicked the sort button</s>.
